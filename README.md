# Virtual-Mouse-Cursor-Controlled-by-hand-movement
A Hand-Controlled Virtual Mouse using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. This project allows users to control their mouse cursor with hand gestures via a webcam. The system detects hand landmarks and translates movements into cursor actions, with smooth tracking and pinch-based clicking.
